This project involved utilizing SQL to extract and analyze data from a simulated retail database. I explored customer purchasing habits, identified top-selling models and manufacturers, and tracked sales trends across multiple years. Here are some key highlights:
•	Customer Segmentation: Identified high-spending customers and analyzed their buying patterns across different years.
•	Sales Performance Analysis: Compared sales performance of various manufacturers and models, pinpointing top sellers and identifying year-over-year trends.
•	Model Comparison: Analyzed sales quantity and average transaction value for different models.
•	Advanced Queries: Employed techniques like ranking, window functions, and common table expressions (CTEs) for complex data analysis.
This project showcased my proficiency in writing SQL queries to solve real-world business problems and gain insights from customer data.
